1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,710
And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory.

2
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:18,310
And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.

3
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:26,850
And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.

4
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:32,109
And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,

5
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:41,570
And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.

6
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,890
And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.

7
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:53,829
And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.

8
00:00:53,829 --> 00:01:07,200
If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,549
Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.

10
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:30,769
And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled. rams: or, he goats

11
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:37,729
And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.

12
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:51,029
And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.

13
00:01:51,029 --> 00:02:04,489
I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.

14
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:12,669
And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?

15
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:20,109
Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.

16
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:31,609
For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.

17
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:36,889
Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;

18
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:50,209
And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.

19
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:56,549
And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.

20
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:02,859
And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.

21
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:11,449
So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.

22
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:15,959
And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.

23
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:23,979
And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.

24
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:33,989
And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

25
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:43,059
Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.

26
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:54,599
And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?

27
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:07,609
Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?

28
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:15,289
And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.

29
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:27,719
It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

30
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:38,089
And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?

31
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:47,689
And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.

32
00:04:47,689 --> 00:05:00,670
With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.

33
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:14,009
And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.

34
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:24,569
Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.

35
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:37,339
And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.

36
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:49,679
And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?

37
00:05:49,679 --> 00:06:02,039
Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.

38
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:11,089
This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.

39
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:22,319
That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.

40
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:30,889
Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.

41
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:43,149
Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.

42
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:59,419
Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.

43
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:18,019
And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?

44
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:25,889
Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.

45
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:30,039
And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.

46
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:39,639
And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.

47
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:49,719
And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed. Jegarsahadutha: that is, The heap of witness, Chaldee

48
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:57,279
And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;

49
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:09,329
And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another. Mizpah: that is, A beacon, or, watchtower

50
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:21,430
If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.

51
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:29,639
And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;

52
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:42,189
This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.

53
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:52,919
The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.

54
00:08:52,919 --> 00:09:05,759
Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount. offered...: or, killed beasts

55
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:16,580
And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.
