1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,220
Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:18,100
The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,310
And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:33,679
And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. Dodanim: or, as some read it, Rodanim

5
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:43,519
By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.

6
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:49,019
And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

7
00:00:49,019 --> 00:01:00,039
And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.

8
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,199
And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.

9
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:12,999
He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.

10
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:23,849
And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. Babel: Gr. Babylon

11
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:37,549
Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, went...: or, he went out into Assyria the city...: or, the streets of the city

12
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:42,609
And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.

13
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:48,779
And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,

14
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:54,919
And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.

15
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:58,829
And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,

16
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:02,649
And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,

17
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:05,889
And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

18
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:13,859
And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.

19
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:28,329
And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

20
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:36,799
These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.

21
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:45,939
Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.

22
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:52,849
The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.

23
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:58,659
And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

24
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:03,169
And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.

25
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:15,750
And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. Peleg: that is Division

26
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:21,800
And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,

27
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,939
And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,

28
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:28,370
And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,

29
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:34,370
And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.

30
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:40,150
And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.

31
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:48,650
These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

32
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:59,500
These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
