1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,779
And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.

2
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:24,479
Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:

3
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:36,140
And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.

4
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:47,520
And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.

5
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:56,620
And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.

6
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:05,430
So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.

7
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:18,460
And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. Elbethel: that is, The God of Bethel

8
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:30,720
But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth. Allonbachuth: that is, The oak of weeping

9
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,790
And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.

10
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:48,240
And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.

11
00:01:48,240 --> 00:02:00,120
And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;

12
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:08,160
And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.

13
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,380
And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.

14
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:23,400
And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.

15
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,540
And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.

16
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:37,280
And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.

17
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:47,340
And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.

18
00:02:47,340 --> 00:03:04,740
And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin. Benoni: that is, The son of my sorrow Benjamin: that is, The son of the right hand

19
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:10,240
And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.

20
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:16,840
And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.

21
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,980
And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.

22
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:34,480
And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:

23
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:44,440
The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:

24
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,040
The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:

25
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,700
And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:

26
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:03,610
And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.

27
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:13,740
And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

28
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,650
And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.

29
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:28,860
And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
