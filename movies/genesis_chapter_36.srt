00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,910
Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.

00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:14,540
Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:55,100
And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.

7
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:03,720
For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.

8
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,969
Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.

These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,
