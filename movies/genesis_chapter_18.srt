1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,129
And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;

2
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:20,039
And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,

3
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:28,699
And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:

4
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:35,879
Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:

5
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:49,179
And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.

6
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:59,979
And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.

7
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:09,339
And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.

8
00:01:09,339 --> 00:01:19,519
And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.

9
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:25,809
And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.

10
00:01:25,809 --> 00:01:39,729
And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.

11
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:47,939
Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

12
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:57,179
Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?

13
00:01:57,179 --> 00:02:06,539
And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?

14
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:16,759
Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.

15
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:25,689
Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.

16
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:32,960
And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

17
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,980
And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;

18
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:46,140
Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?

19
00:02:46,140 --> 00:03:00,660
For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.

20
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:08,220
And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;

21
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:17,990
I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.

22
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:25,570
And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.

23
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:31,760
And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?

24
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:41,170
Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?

25
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:53,770
That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?

26
00:03:53,770 --> 00:04:02,030
And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

27
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:11,130
And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes:

28
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:23,950
Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.

29
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:34,220
And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.

30
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:47,540
And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.

31
00:04:47,540 --> 00:05:00,189
And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.

32
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:13,149
And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.

33
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:21,500
And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.
