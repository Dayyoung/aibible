And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:22,950
And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.

00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:31,970
These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,

And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.

00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:24,100
And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

10
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:31,880
And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.

11
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:39,130
The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;

12
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:44,550
And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.

13
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:51,320

17
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:28,830
But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.

18
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:35,910
And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

19
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:54,200
And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. Adam: or, the man

20
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:04,900

22
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:22,659
And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.

23

And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.

24
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:41,399
Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

25
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:46,419
And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
