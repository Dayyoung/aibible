1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,459
And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

2
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:15,519
And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. from...: or, eastward

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:25,980
And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.

4
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:39,490
And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

5
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:45,150
And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.

6
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:58,370
And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

7
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:06,170
Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.

8
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:13,629
So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.

9
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:28,560
Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. Babel: that is, Confusion

And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.
