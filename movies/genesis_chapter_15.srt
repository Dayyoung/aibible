1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,470
After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:22,009
And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?

3
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:30,649
And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.

4
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:43,009
And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.

5
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:55,729
And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.

6
00:00:55,729 --> 00:01:00,909
And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.

7
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:09,209
And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.

8
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:14,439
And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?

9
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:26,269
And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.

10
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:36,009
And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.

11
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:41,219
And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.

12
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:50,839
And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.

13
00:01:50,839 --> 00:02:03,249
And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;

14
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:11,699
And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.

15
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:18,039
And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.

16
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:25,219
But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.

17
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:36,669
And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.

18
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:49,009
In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:

19
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:52,780
The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,

20
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,669
And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,

21
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:02,549
And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
