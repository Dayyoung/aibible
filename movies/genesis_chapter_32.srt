1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,580
And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:17,710
And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim. Mahanaim: that is, Two hosts, or, camps

3
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:25,080
And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:37,439
And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:

5
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:49,320
And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.

6
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:59,859
And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.

7
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:11,400
Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;

8
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:19,270
And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.

9
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:33,530
And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:

10
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:47,110
I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.

11
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:58,970
Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.

12
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:08,160
And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.

13
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:15,220
And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;

14
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:21,200
Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,

15
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:29,220
Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.

16
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:41,820
And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.

17
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:55,360
And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?

18
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:06,420
Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.

19
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:17,800
And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.

20
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:32,870
And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.

21
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:38,680
So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.

22
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:49,480
And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.

23
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,450
And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.

24
00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:00,330
And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.

25
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:11,080
And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.

26
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:19,480
And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.

27
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,470
And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.

28
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:38,610
And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. Israel: that is, A prince of God

29
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:50,850
And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.

30
00:04:50,850 --> 00:05:01,840
And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. Peniel: that is, The face of God

31
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,910
And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.

32
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:21,640
Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.
