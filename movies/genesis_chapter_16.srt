1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,380
Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:24,000
And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:35,539
And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.

4
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:45,019
And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

5
00:00:45,019 --> 00:00:59,559
And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.

6
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:11,849
But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.

7
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:19,429
And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

8
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:31,069
And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.

9
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:38,439
And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.

10
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:47,200
And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

11
00:01:47,200 --> 00:02:03,540
And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction. Ishmael: that is, God shall hear

12
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:14,200
And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.

13
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:24,210
And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?

14
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:35,490
Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered. Beerlahairoi: that is, The well of him that liveth and seeth me

15
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:43,000
And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.

16
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,020
And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.
