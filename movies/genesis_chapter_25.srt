1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,509
Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.

2
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:11,949
And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.

3
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:20,250
And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:29,850
And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.

5
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,210
And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.

6
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:46,750
But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.

7
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:54,259
And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.

8
00:00:54,259 --> 00:01:03,979
Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.

9
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:14,200
And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;

10
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:21,689
The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.

11
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:30,280
And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.

12
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:40,189
Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:

13
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:53,609
And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,

14
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:56,590
And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

15
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:03,930
Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: Hadar: or, Hadad

16
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:14,370
These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.

17
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:24,980
And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.

18
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:35,230
And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.

19
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:41,850
And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:

20
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:52,190
And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.

21
00:02:52,190 --> 00:03:01,860
And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.

22
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:11,460
And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.

23
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:26,080
And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.

24
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,130
And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.

25
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:38,440
And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.

26
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:49,720
And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.

27
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:59,060
And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.

28
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:05,400
And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.

29
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,110
And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:

30
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:23,420
And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.  Edom: that is Red

31
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,000
And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.

32
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,220
And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?

33
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:42,040
And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.

34
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:53,390
Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.
